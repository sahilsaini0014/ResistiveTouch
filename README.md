### Introduction


### Bill of Materials/Budget
![budget](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43186158/49831451-ecb8f700-fd61-11e8-9a25-f1d0d24ab567.PNG)
#### So this is the budget that I have made in my fourth week of the Project. As I had'nt buy any thing after that So my budget remained  same till end of the project. If you wanna check the receipts, you can click <a href="https://sahilsaini0014.github.io/ResistiveTouch/#october-2-2018---week-5">here</a>



### Time Commitment
* Time to complete this project would be around 4 days if you have everything handy with the build instruction. It took me couple of weeks to complete this project.In the first week,I had to research about my project, plan my budget accordingly and wait for the items to be delivered. During that time I learned how to connect my Raspberry Pi remotely and researched about my controller more deeply.

* Well, if you are free for couple of days and want to make something interesting, I would suggest you to try this and let me know if you have any questions. My email address is sahilsiani0014@gmail.com. Feel free to contact me.



### Mechanical Assembly
* Since this Project requires no more than two components, we just have to connect Resistive Touch Screen with the Raspberry Pi connected to the STMPE610 controller. Below are picture while I was making this hardware setup.

* And below is my final hardware on which my Resistive Touch Screen is attached on top of the case.
