### Introduction


### Bill of Materials/Budget



### Time Commitment
* Time to complete this project would be around 4 days if you have everything handy with the build instruction. It took me couple of weeks to complete this project.In the first week,I had to research about my project, plan my budget accordingly and wait for the items to be delivered. During that time I learned how to connect my Raspberry Pi remotely and researched about my controller more deeply.

* Well, if you are free for couple of days and want to make something interesting, I would suggest you to try this and let me know if you have any questions. My email address is sahilsiani0014@gmail.com. Feel free to contact me.
